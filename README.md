# MyCalculator
This Calculator app was created in Android studio. It uses a relative layout for the UI. It uses the logic and parser from my expert-calculator java repository.

# Future Updates
Updates will be made to create new activities (an activity represents a single screen with a user interface just like window or frame of Java):
- [x] Basic arithmetic functions
- [ ] Quadratic Solver
- [ ] System of Linear equations solver
- [ ] Basic Matrix Operations
